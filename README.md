# Pointnet-CW-attack
This is a revised code of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00593">Pointnet</a> and the <a href = "https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.04644">C&W attack</a>. This implementation of Pointnet reaches accuracy of 88.2% in classification task on Modelnet40 dataset. the parameters of the model are all similar to the parameters used in the original implementation.
